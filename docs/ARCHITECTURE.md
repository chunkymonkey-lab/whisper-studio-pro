# Technical Architecture

WhisperStudio Pro implements a modular architecture that separates concerns while maintaining high performance and scalability. This document outlines the core architectural decisions and implementation details.

## Core Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data processing components. The main architectural layers consist of the presentation layer (GUI), the business logic layer (transcription and processing), and the data layer (file handling and storage).

### Component Overview

The presentation layer utilizes PyQt6 to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface. This layer handles all user interactions and provides real-time feedback during processing operations. The GUI components are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

The business logic layer contains the core transcription and audio processing functionality. This layer implements the Whisper models for transcription and the SpeechBrain framework for speaker diarization. The processing pipeline is designed to handle multiple file formats and maintain high accuracy while optimizing resource usage.

The data layer manages file operations, caching, and persistent storage. This layer implements efficient streaming mechanisms for handling large audio files and maintains proper memory management during processing operations.

## Data Flow

Audio processing follows a structured pipeline:

1. Audio Input Processing: The system validates and normalizes incoming audio files, ensuring compatibility with the processing pipeline.

2. Transcription Processing: The normalized audio undergoes transcription using the selected Whisper model, with configurable parameters for optimization.

3. Speaker Diarization: When enabled, the SpeechBrain framework analyzes the audio to identify and separate different speakers.

4. Post-Processing: The system applies any selected filters or modifications, such as punctuation correction or format-specific formatting.

5. Output Generation: The final processed content is formatted according to user preferences and saved to the specified location.

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through its modular design. Processing components can be distributed across available computing resources, and the system can leverage both CPU and GPU acceleration where available.

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling at each layer:

1. Input Validation: Robust checking of file formats and content before processing begins.

2. Processing Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of resource usage and processing status.

3. Recovery Mechanisms: Automatic recovery procedures for common failure scenarios.

4. User Feedback: Clear error reporting and suggested resolutions for user-facing issues.

## Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future enhancements through:

1. Plugin System: A modular design that allows for new processing capabilities.

2. API Integration: Well-defined interfaces for external system integration.

3. Model Updates: Support for new versions of Whisper and SpeechBrain models.

4. Format Support: Extensible format handling for new input and output types.
