# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development processes and procedures for contributing to WhisperStudio Pro. Following these guidelines ensures consistent code quality and efficient collaboration.

## Development Environment Setup

The development environment requires specific configuration to ensure consistent development practices:

1. Python Environment Configuration: The project uses Python 3.8 or higher with virtual environment isolation. Development tools include pylint for code analysis and black for formatting.

2. IDE Configuration: Standard IDE settings ensure consistent code formatting and development practices across the team.

3. Testing Framework: PyTest serves as the primary testing framework, with coverage reporting enabled.

## Branch Strategy

The project follows a modified GitFlow workflow:

1. Main Branch (main): Contains the production-ready code. All releases are tagged from this branch.

2. Development Branch (develop): Integration branch for feature development. All feature branches merge here first.

3. Feature Branches (feature/*): Created for new feature development. These branch from and merge back into develop.

4. Release Branches (release/*): Created when preparing a new release. Contains version-specific fixes.

5. Hotfix Branches (hotfix/*): Created for urgent production fixes. These branch from main and merge to both main and develop.

## Code Review Process

All code changes undergo a structured review process:

1. Pre-submission Requirements: Code must pass all automated tests and meet style guidelines.

2. Review Assignment: At least one core team member must review each pull request.

3. Review Criteria: Reviewers evaluate code quality, test coverage, and documentation completeness.

4. Merge Requirements: All comments must be addressed and approval received before merging.

## Release Process

The release process follows a structured approach:

1. Version Planning: Features and fixes are grouped into planned releases.

2. Release Preparation: Version numbers are assigned following semantic versioning.

3. Testing Phase: Comprehensive testing on release candidates.

4. Documentation Update: Release notes and documentation are prepared.

5. Deployment: Automated deployment processes handle distribution.

## Quality Assurance

Quality assurance measures include:

1. Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests must maintain high coverage.

2. Performance Testing: Regular benchmarking of core functionality.

3. Security Review: Regular security audits of dependencies and code.

4. Documentation Review: Technical documentation must remain current with changes.
